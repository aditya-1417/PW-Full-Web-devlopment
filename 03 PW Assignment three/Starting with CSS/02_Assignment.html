    <h1>About CSS</h1>
    <p style="background-color: yellow; color: red;">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a programming language used to style and format the visual appearance of HTML and XML 
        documents. It allows web developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other design elements of a website. CSS 
        works by applying styles to HTML elements using selectors, which target specific elements based on their type, class, 
        ID, or other attributes. With CSS, you can create consistent and visually appealing web pages, enhance user experience,
         and make your website responsive to different devices and screen sizes.</p>
