    <h1>Comments:</h1>
    <p>
        HTML comments are enclosed between <!-- and -->. Anything placed between these delimiters is considered a 
        comment and is ignored by the browser when rendering the web page.Purpose: Comments in HTML are primarily 
        intended for developers, allowing them to annotate their code and provide context or explanations. This 
        can be helpful when collaborating with others or revisiting the code at a later stage.Disabling Code: By 
        wrapping a portion of code within comments, developers can temporarily disable that code without deleting it. 
        This can be useful for troubleshooting or testing alternative solutions.Organizing Code: Comments can also
        be used to divide code into sections or mark the beginning and end of specific sections. This aids in code 
        organization and makes it easier to navigate and understand complex HTML documents.Best Practices: While 
        comments are valuable for developers, it is generally recommended to avoid excessive or redundant commenting. 
        Comments should be concise, relevant, and provide meaningful insights without cluttering the code unnecessarily.
