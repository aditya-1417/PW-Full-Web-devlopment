        <p>
            Web design is the creative process of conceptualizing and visually designing the layout, 
            appearance, and user experience of websites. It involves a combination of artistic skills, 
            technical knowledge, and an understanding of user behavior to create visually appealing and 
            functional web interfaces.
            <br>
            In web design, the focus is on creating visually engaging and intuitive designs that effectively
             communicate the brand identity, purpose, and message of a website. It involves selecting color
             schemes, typography, graphics, and other visual elements to create a cohesive and aesthetically 
             pleasing user interface.
